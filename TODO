- Stuff to implement:

  - Allow mtr to log the return packets, for later analysis.

  - Request timestamping at the remote site.
       Andreas Fasbender has an algorithm that will allow us to 
       convert these measurements into one-way measurements, not just
       round-trip.

  - Allow mtr to also send larger packets. 
       This will enable us to get a feel for the speed of the links
       we're traversing. (Van Jacobson was working on this His tool
       was slow, mtr will rock with this feature.... :-)
       (Anybody have the statistics experience to tell me how
       to do the data analysis?)

  - Allow MTR to keep on getting the icmp host unreachables, and
    work through that. Some hosts don't answer PINGs.

- Bugs to fix?
  - ?
