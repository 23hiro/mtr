.TH MTR-PACKET 8 "@VERSION@" "mtr-packet" "System Administration"
.HP 7
.SH NAME
mtr-packet - send and receive network probes
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mtr-packet
reads command requests from
.I stdin,
each separated by a newline character, and responds with command replies to
.IR stdout ,
also each separated by a newline character.  The syntactic structure of
requests and replies are the same.  The following format is used:
.LP
.RS
.I TOKEN
.I COMMAND
[\c
.I ARGUMENT-NAME
.I ARGUMENT-VALUE
\&...]
.RE
.LP
.I TOKEN
is a unique integer value.  The same value will be used as the
.I TOKEN
for the response.  This is necessary for associating replies with requests,
as commands may be completed in a different order than they are requested.
The invoker of
.B mtr-packet
should always use the
.I TOKEN
value to determine which command request has completed.
.LP
.I COMMAND
is a string identifying the command request type.  A common command is
.BR send-probe ,
which will transmit one network probe.
.LP
.I ARGUMENT-NAME
strings and
.I ARGUMENT-VALUE
strings always come in pairs.  It is a syntactic error to provide an
.I ARGUMENT-NAME
without a corresponding
.IR ARGUMENT-VALUE .
Valid
.I ARGUMENT-NAME
strings depend on the
.I COMMAND
being used.
.SH REQUESTS
.TP
.B send-probe
Send a network probe to a particular IP address.  An IP address must be
provided as an argument.
.B send-probe
will reply with
.BR reply ,
.BR no-reply ,
or
.BR ttl-expired .
.IP
The following arguments may be used:
.IP
.B ip-4
.I IP-ADDRESS
.HP 14
.IP
The Internet Protocol version 4 address to probe.
.HP 7
.IP
.B timeout
.I TIMEOUT-SECONDS
.HP 14
.IP
The number of seconds to wait for a response to the probe before discarding
the probe as lost, and generating a
.B no-reply
command reply.
.HP 7
.IP
.B ttl
.I TIME-TO-LIVE
.HP 14
.IP
The time-to-live value for the Internet Protocol packet header used in
constructing the probe.  This value determines the number of network hops
through which the probe will travel before a response is generated by an
intermediate network host.
.HP 7
.TP
.B check-support
Check for support for a particular feature in this version of
.B mtr-packet
and in this particular operating environment.
.B check-support
will reply with
.BR feature-supported .
A
.B feature
argument is required.
.HP 7
.IP
.B feature
.I FEATURE-NAME
.HP 14
.IP
The name of a feature requested.  Some features which can be checked are
.B send-probe
and
.BR ip-4 .
The feature
.B version
can be checked to retrieve the version of
.BR mtr-packet .
.SH REPLIES
.TP
.B reply
The destination host received the
.B send-probe
probe and replied.  Arguments of the reply are the following:
.HP 7
.IP
.B ip-4
.I IP-ADDRESS
.HP 14
.IP
The Internet Protocol address of the host which replied to the
probe.
.HP 7
.IP
.B round-trip-time
.I TIME
.HP 14
.IP
The time which passed between the transmission of the probe and its
response.  The time is provided as a integral number of microseconds
elapsed.
.HP 7
.TP
.B no-reply
No response to the probe request was received before the timeout
expired.
.TP
.B ttl-expired
The time-to-live value of the transmitted probe expired before the probe
arrived at its intended destination.  Arguments of
.B ttl-expired
are:
.HP 7
.IP
.B ip-4
.I IP-ADDRESS
.HP 14
.IP
The Internet Protocol address of the host at which the time-to-live value
expired.
.HP 7
.IP
.B round-trip-time
.I TIME
.HP 14
.IP
The time which passed between the transmission of the probe and its
response.  The time is provided as a integral number of microseconds
elapsed.
.HP 7
.TP
.B feature-support
A reply to provided to
.B check-support
indicating the availability of a particular feature.  The argument provided
is:
.HP 7
.IP
.B support
.I PRESENT
.HP 14
.IP
In most cases, the
.I PRESENT
value will be either
.BR ok ,
indicating the feature is supported, or
.BR no ,
indicating no support for the feature.
.IP
In the case that
.B version
is the requested
.IR FEATURE-NAME ,
the version of
.B mtr-packet
is provided as the
.I PRESENT
value.
.HP 7
.SH EXAMPLE
A controlling program may start
.B mtr-packet
as a child process and issue the following command on
.IR stdin :
.LP
.RS
42 send-probe ip-4 127.0.0.1
.RE
.LP
This will send a network probe to the loopback interface.  When the probe
completes,
.B
mtr-packet
will provide a response on
.I stdout
such as the following:
.LP
.RS
42 reply ip-4 127.0.0.1 round-trip-time 126
.RE
.LP
This indicates that the loopback address replied to the probe, and the
round-trip time of the probe was 126 microseconds.
